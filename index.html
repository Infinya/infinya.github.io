              designing a login interface/database etc and have assignments with
              the same in the coming weeks rather than spending a lot of time with HTML and CSS.

For instance, you could use a cypher code, replacing each character with another specified character.  For a really simple example, you can encrypt words by sending each letter to the following letter, replacing each "a" with "b", "b" with "c", and so on.  Then the word "apple" would become "bqqmf".  (If you want, you can try coming up with a more sophisticated encryption scheme.) Test your programs by encrypting and decrypting a large text file, like the novel Moby Dick.
